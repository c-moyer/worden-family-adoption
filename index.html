      Hello, we are Jonathan and Raquel Worden. We both strive to serve the Lord.
      Jonathan currently works as a Sales Manager for the Hilton Memphis and I am an Administrative
      Assistant for a commercial real estate agent here in Mississippi where we live. We are so
      grateful that you have given us your time to get to know our story. We cannot fully comprehend
      what it is that you are dealing with, all of the difficult thoughts and hard questions to
      answer. We can’t even start to understand the amount of strength it takes to even be open to a
      decision like this and we thank God for your love for your sweet baby and your courage. If
      there is one thing we know its that no matter the challenge, no matter the sorrow-  God is
      still good and He sees you. He sees your hurt, He sees your pain, and He knows every detail of
      who you are and who your baby is. We hope you will take the time to read on and know just
      how much we understand this heartache. We want to give you the space to process all of the
      complexities that you are dealing with right now and we pray that we have a chance to meet you,
      but until then, we hope this profile allows you to meet us a little.
    </p>
