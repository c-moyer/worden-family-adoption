          Raquel is a God fearing woman, the perfect wife, a daughter and true friend.  Raquel accepted Jesus later in her life than I did, which I believe makes her a stronger and more faithful believer in Jesus. She consistently reads her bible in the mornings while drinking her coffee and sitting with our pups before she heads off to work. Memorizing scripture is another strength of this lady I call my wife. Raquel puts her own rest and relaxation aside to serve our church and others alike. She is great at helping me to live a Christ-like life even when things are tough or not going my way.

          Raquel is the sweet wife that I needed/wanted to have in my life. The moment I got to know her I knew, more than I had ever known, that she was the one God had for me. We are both strong willed people who sometimes get stuck in our ways but since being married we even each other out and encourage each other to see another side. This has helped me with other people in my life. Around people she does not know, my wife tends to be pretty introverted and quiet. When her friends come around, though, she is very fun and has the best laugh with this cute snort when she really gets rolling. But no matter who she is around she is always very calm, patient, kind, and really very warm with a quiet strength. The Lord uses Raquel to give me drive, strength, and a will to do my best in life. I feel at home where Raquel is, that can be in our home, in the car, at church, or anywhere else.

          Raquel is a true friend who is willing to listen and admonish and be honest with her friends when needed.  Even though she is not a mama to kids in our home she is a mama to those in our lives. She is always the first one to come pray along a friend's side and is an open ear for those friends to express themselves. She is always very understanding even when she doesn't agree she just tries to let them talk out whatever it is on their mind. Raquel is especially bubbly when with these friends. I love when she is with her friends because I get to see this mature, playful woman I married. Raquel also  has a heart for those with special needs and can connect and understand them more than most. She has made a lot of sweet friends through them. She loves all of her people really big and goes to great lengths to love her friends well.

          Raquel is a daughter who has some of her parents best qualities. She is intelligent, creative, brave and hardworking just like both of her parents. Raquel loves to go boating and fishing with her dad and enjoying the outdoors after long weeks of being cooped up in an office. Raquel loves to play board games and put puzzles together with her mother. I believe this is how they keep their minds sharp and creative. They are all quick witted and very intelligent.

          Raquel has a few hobbies that she loves to enjoy, when time permits, or when I don't have a mile long to do list for her to help me with. Her most favorite thing to do is bake and try out new baking ideas. Raquel loves everything about baking; the science behind it, decorating, and most importantly the stories behind each product she makes. Raquel loves to paint and will paint images of what a cake looks like in her mind before she bakes it. She likes to paint scenery images with special scriptures with them.  Raquel also has a love of music, just like I do with the exception of I have no musical abilities. This woman likes all kinds of music from Christian music to rap to country new and old to soft rock and her coffee house music ( I could do with out! LOL). In fact, I met her when she was playing her flute in the church band. I love to listen to her play even though she usually kicks me out when she's practicing. I hope our children pick up her musical talents because it is a language that she knows so well and talks to others through with alot of grace.

          All in all, Raquel is a very graceful, organized, fun-loving, honest, Christ follower with many talents and interests. I love that she uses her gifts to glorify God and bring joy to others. She constantly shares her heart with anyone she can. These things and many others make her the unique person that I love.
